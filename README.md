# TreeGST: Generative Pre-Trained Transformer for Forestry Applications

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**: This project is currently under active development as part of a Master's thesis at BFH (Bern University of Applied Sciences).

## Project Overview

TreeGST is an adaptation of the PointGPT architecture specifically designed for forest point cloud data processing. The project aims to leverage self-supervised learning techniques to improve the analysis of forest LiDAR data for tasks such as tree species recognition and segmentation.

## Project Status

This repository is based on the [PointGST](https://github.com/jerryfeng2003/PointGST) implementation and is being modified for forestry applications. The work is in its initial stages and major changes are expected.

## Timeline

- Project Start: December 2024
- Expected Completion: July 2025
